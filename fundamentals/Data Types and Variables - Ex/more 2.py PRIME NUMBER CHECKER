# 2. Prime Number Checker
#
# Write a program to check if a number is prime.
# A prime number is a natural number greater than 1, not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
# For example, the only ways of writing 5 as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself.
#
# The input comes as an integer number.
#
# The output should be True if the number is prime and False otherwise.

# a whole number greater than 1 that cannot be exactly divided by any whole number other than itself and 1 (e.g. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
# "prime numbers are very useful in cryptography"

num = int(input())
is_prime = True

if num == 0 or num == 1:
    is_prime = False
elif num > 1:
    # check for factors
    for i in range(2, num):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break

print(is_prime)
